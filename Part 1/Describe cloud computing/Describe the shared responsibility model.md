- The shared responsibility model is heavily tied into the cloud service types:
	- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
		- IaaS places the most responsibility on the consumer, with the cloud provider being responsible for the basics of physical security, power, and connectivity.
	- Platform as a service (PaaS)
		- PaaS, being a middle ground between IaaS and SaaS.
	- Software as a service (SaaS)
		- SaaS places most of the responsibility with the cloud provider

Youâ€™ll always be responsible for:

- The information and data stored in the cloud
- Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
- The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

The cloud provider is always responsible for:

- The physical datacenter
- The physical network
- The physical hosts

Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:

- Operating systems
- Network controls
- Applications
- Identity and infrastructure
